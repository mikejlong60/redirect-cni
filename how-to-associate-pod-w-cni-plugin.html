In Kind, configured to use CNI, how can I apply a specific CNI plugin to a specific pod in my Kubernetes cluster?

To apply a specific CNI plugin to a specific pod in a Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster, you can use the multi-CNI capability provided by Kubernetes, allowing you to specify CNI networks on a per-pod basis. However, this requires that you have configured multiple CNI plugins on the cluster. Here’s how you can approach this:
Prerequisites

Kind uses a single-node or multi-node cluster within Docker, and it comes with a basic CNI setup by default.
To use custom CNI configurations, you'll need to:
Configure Kind to use the CNI plugin of your choice.
Install additional CNI plugins in the /etc/cni/net.d/ directory on the Kind nodes.
Ensure that the desired CNI plugin is compatible with Kubernetes.

Steps to Apply a Specific CNI Plugin to a Specific Pod

Install Additional CNI Plugins:
You can manually install multiple CNI plugins in a Kind cluster by placing the configuration files in /etc/cni/net.d/ inside the Kind node container.
SSH into the Kind node container:

bash

docker exec -it kind-control-plane /bin/sh

Download or copy the CNI plugin binaries and configuration files to /etc/cni/net.d/.

Use the k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks Annotation:

Kubernetes allows specifying additional CNI configurations for individual pods using the k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks annotation. This allows you to specify which CNI plugin to apply to a particular pod.
Assuming you have a CNI configuration file for a custom CNI plugin (e.g., custom-cni.conf), you can apply it to a pod like this:

yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: my-custom-pod
annotations:
k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: custom-cni
spec:
containers:
- name: my-container
image: my-image

This custom-cni should match the name defined in the name field of the CNI configuration JSON file.

Verify and Apply the Configuration:

After applying the pod manifest, verify that the network has been applied by checking the pod's networking setup:

bash

kubectl describe pod my-custom-pod

You should see references to the custom CNI network in the pod’s network annotations.

Restart CNI Plugins if Needed:
If the changes don't seem to take effect, you may need to restart the CNI plugin pods or the Kind node to ensure that the CNI configurations are properly picked up.

Example of a CNI Configuration File

Here’s an example of a simple CNI configuration for a custom-cni that could be placed in /etc/cni/net.d/custom-cni.conf:

json

{
"cniVersion": "0.3.1",
"name": "custom-cni",
"type": "bridge",
"bridge": "br-custom",
"isDefaultGateway": true,
"ipam": {
"type": "host-local",
"subnet": "10.244.0.0/16"
}
}

This file defines a bridge CNI plugin that creates a custom bridge network named br-custom.

Notes on Using CNI with Kind

Kind itself does not inherently support dynamic addition of CNI plugins after cluster creation, so it's crucial that you plan your CNI setup before starting the cluster.
Kind will use the first .conflist or .conf file it finds in /etc/cni/net.d/ as the default CNI, but using annotations allows you to add custom plugins.
Using multiple CNI plugins may require understanding their interaction, especially regarding IPAM (IP Address Management).

Summary

Install additional CNI plugins into the Kind node.
Use the k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks annotation in the pod specification to apply a custom CNI plugin.
Verify the setup and restart the CNI DaemonSet if needed.
Make sure that your Kind cluster is set up with a compatible CNI configuration to prevent conflicts.

By using these steps, you can control which CNI plugin is applied to specific pods in a Kind-based Kubernetes cluster.
